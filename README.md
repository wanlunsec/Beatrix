# Beatrix
##### This is the source code for the paper "The *Beatrix* Resurrections: Robust Backdoor Detection via Gram Matrices".

## Dynamic Backdoor Attacks
- Input-Aware Dynamic Backdoor Attack (NeurIPS'20) [[code](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/input-aware-backdoor-attack-release)]
- Invisible Backdoor Attack with Sample-Specific Triggers (ICCV'21) [[code](https://github.com/yuezunli/ISSBA)]
- Dynamic Backdoor Attacks Against Machine Learning Models (Euro S&P'22)

In this demo implementation, we only include input-aware dynamic backdoor.
## Backdoor Detection Methods
Beatrix and other baseline methods are included in *./defenses*
